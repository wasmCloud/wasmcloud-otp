# ⚠️ Test Capability Providers
These capability providers are _NOT_ the officially supported first party providers. You can find those [here](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers/).

Do **NOT** use these providers for your own application. These providers exist for the sole purpose of testing the provider interface contracts and running our integration test suite. 

At some point in the near future, it is highly likely that these providers will be removed.
