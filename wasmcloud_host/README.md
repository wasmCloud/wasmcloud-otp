# wasmCloud Host - Web UI Dashboard
This is the web UI dashboard that provides for a basic way to interact with a host and its associated lattice. This web application automatically starts the [host_core](../host_core/README.md) application as a dependency.

## Phoenix

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser. If you supply a `PORT` environment variable you can alter the default port on which this application listens for HTTP requests.
